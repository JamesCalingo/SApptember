# SApptember
30 Days, 30 Web Apps

# What it is
Sapptember is a project of 30 different web pages/applications created over the course of 30 days of September 2019. There is a wide variety of apps in this project, such as:<br/>

- A football scoreboard where the user can click different buttons and add different point values to two totals (home and away)
- A "Magic 8 Ball" which takes in a user question, repeats the question back to the user, and then gives a random response
- A "baseball game" where the user must decide whether or not to swing at a pitch and tries to score enough runs to win a game
- A "take your shot" game where the user must make a certain number of passes before shooting a ball into a goal
- And many more!
