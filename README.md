# SApptember
30 Days, 30 Web Apps

# What it is
Sapptember is a project of 30 different web pages/applications created over the course of 30 days of September 2019. There is a wide variety of apps in this project, such as:<br/>

- A football scoreboard where the user can click different buttons and add different point values to two totals (home and away)
- A "Magic 8 Ball" which takes in a user question, repeats the question back to the user, and then gives a random response
- A "baseball game" where the user must decide whether or not to swing at a pitch and tries to score enough runs to win a game
- A "take your shot" game where the user must make a certain number of passes before shooting a ball into a goal
- And many more!

# How to Use
This project is available online at http://jamescalingo.com/SApptember, or if you wish to have it locally, you can simply clone the repository onto your machine by using git clone git@github.com:JamesCalingo/SApptember.git in your computer's terminal program.<br/>

I've set it up so that you can simply use the index.html page to access everything.
