  <h1>Are you ready for what I have planned for today?</h1>
  <h2>Because I don't think you are.</h2>

  <p>Consider this:<br>
    Did you ever realize that this month of apps is almost over? <br>
    Even if some of these aren't quite "apps"...<br>
    Frankly, I'm not sure what to think.</p>

  <p>Half of me wants this to be done.<br>
    I always have a tough time coming up with ideas for this project.<br>
    Just look at this page, for example.<br>
    Kooky rambling, but no real substance.</p>

  <p>Looking at the future after this project is interesting.<br>
    Maybe I'll go back and look at old things I've done.<br>
    New projects are also possible for me.<br>
    Only time will tell.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it's time to focus on today, though.<br>
    "Quit yammering about nothing man!"<br>
    Responds the increasingly annoyed reader that I have made up.</p>

  <p>So let's get to business.<br>
    Today's app is...<br>
    Unknown still.<br>
    Vanity time is over, however.</p>

  <p>Well I guess it's time to do something.</p>

  <p>You'll know what that something is in three, two, one...</p>
