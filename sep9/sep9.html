<title>Bottom of the 9th</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="jumbotron my-0 py-2">
  <p>it's the bottom of the 9th - we're down by ten runs, and we NEED this win to keep our season alive. Can you help us get the win?</p>
  </div>

  <p>We're giving you control of our batters. The pitcher will throw a pitch either down the middle or outside, and you have to decide whether or not to swing at it.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the pitch is down the middle and you swing at it, it's a hit! (For our purposes, all hits will be singles)</li>
    <li>If the pitch is outside and you choose not to swing, it's a ball. Four balls and you get a baserunner for free!</li>
    <li>If the pitch is down the middle and you don't swing, or if the pitch is outside and you do swing at it, it's a strike. Three strikes and you're out!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you score four runs before you make three outs, we win! Otherwise...we lose.</p>
  
  <h3>Can you do it?</h3>
