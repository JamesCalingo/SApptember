<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>After some mental deliberation. you decide to kill Brittany. Steve ends up following you and Brittany is chosen as the mafia's next victim.</p>

<p>Her death is announced the next day, and seeing as how Steve didn't vote for Chloe in the previous round, suspicion falls on him immediately. However, Steve, who isn't known for his strategic thinking, brings up a brilliant point:</p>

<h4>There's no hard evidence that Chloe was mafia.</h4>

<p>Sure, the vote was heavily against her, but maybe that's because everyone just trusted Erica too much (Brittany sure did), which is not necessarily a good idea. With this, Steve accuses Erica of being mafia.</p>

<p>John finally does something meaningful and says that he believes Olivia more than Steve. Alex is undecided.</p>

<p>You know you have to get Alex on your side to claim victory.</p>
