  <title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p>You decide to go after Michael, claiming that he should be voted out based on his history with the game. You know
    that he's a smart player, and that if he's mafia, he can manipulate things to his advantage.</p>

  <p>Bad idea.</p>

  <p>Michael reveals himself as the investigator, saying that he investigated you and found out that you were a mafia
    member. You try to rebut it as an attempt to get a villager killed, but...you're not very good at lying, especially
    when Michael puts more pressure on you.</p>

  <p>Long story short: you get voted out, your fellow mafia members spend the rest of the game unsuccessfully trying to
    kill Michael (he gets healed every time the mafia tries to kill him), and the town eventually wins.</p>
