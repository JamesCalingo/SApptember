<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You take the second card, and it is...a King! You are one of the three killers for this round.</p>

<p>Kate tells everyone to close their eyes, which you do. When she tells the mafia to open your eyes, you do so and look around for your fellow killers - Chloe and Steve. She tells you to all point at someone who you want to kill; after a little bit of silent "discussion", the three of you decide to kill George's girlfriend (Or is she his sister? You're not completely sure of their relatioinship or her name - but you think her name was something weird like Ira). Kate then tells you all to close your eyes.</p>

<p>When Kate wakes the group for the day phase, she announces that the person you selected during the night has died (without actually saying her name - Kate just points at her and tells her she's dead). You look around at the group: there are at least three people who you think would be easy targets for voting out: Michael, Dave, and Alex.</p>
