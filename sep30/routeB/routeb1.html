<p>You take the second card, and it is...a King! You are one of the three killers for this round.</p>

<p>Kate tells everyone to close their eyes, which you do. When she tells the mafia to open your eyes, you do so and look around for your fellow killers - . She tells you to all point at someone who you want to kill; after a little bit of silent discussion, the three of you choose a target. Kate then tells you all to close your eyes.</p>

<p>When Kate wakes the group for the day phase, she announces that the person you selected during the night has died. You look around at the group: there are at least three people who you think would be easy targets for voting out: Michael, Dave, and Alex.</p>

<h1>Who do you go after?</h1>
