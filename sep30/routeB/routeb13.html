<h1>HOW COULD YOU?</h1>

<p>Why are you trying to kill one of the most beloved pop icons of the 1980s? Sure, he's actually dead now, but how can you just erase the guy who gave the world Careless Whisper, Faith, and all those other things he did with that other dude in Wham!?</p>

<p>Wait, I think I got my people mixed up...let's try that again.</p>

<p>Why are you trying to kill that dude from the sports show? Sure, he's already dead, but why are you trying to kill him again? Do you really hate the Dallas Cowboys that much?</p>

<p>Oh shoot...that's probably not the person you're thinking of either...um...</p>

<p>WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL A FICTIONAL CHARACTER? Is the family from Arrested Development that dysfunctional that you think he'd be better off dead than dealing with his grandparents, crazy aunt, and uncles (as well as his unrequited feelings for his cousin)? Do you have a personal vendetta against Michael Cera? Have you seen Juno or Scott Pilgrim vs. the World?</p>

<p>Anyway, I hate you now and you lose.</p>
