<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You decide to latch onto Steve's argument in order to convince Alex that Olivia is mafia. Alex hesitates for a bit before deciding to "go with the boys" and Olivia gets voted out.</p>

<p>Steve is ready to celebrate a mafia win, but before he does, Kate asks everyone to close their eyes again. She then does a normal night phase (you and Steve don't even agree on a target, but you don't have to - Kate just has you close your eyes after about ten seconds). When she wakes the town the following morning, she states that life in the town may continue, but under the dark cloud of mafia rule - the mafia has won the game.</p>

<p>as you celebrate with Chloe and Steve, everyone talks about the moves that were made and how they affected the game. Michael was the investigator and found out that Chloe was mafia, but couldn't really say anything because he REALLY didn't want to get killed early. Unfortunately for him, the doctor was Dave, who you got voted out of town early in the game.</p>

<p>Chloe commends you for having the guts to vote her out. She admits that she was a bit mad that you did it, but it ended up being a smart move because you never drew any suspicion from the other townspeople.</p>

<p>The group decides to play again with a twist - the moderator will be decided with the cards as well as everyone else's roles. Kate volunteers to shuffle and deal the cards, and you end up with a joker, making you the moderator for the next round. You stand up and prepare the group for another game.</p>
