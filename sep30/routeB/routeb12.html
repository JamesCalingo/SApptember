<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You elect to kill George. As funny as his rant was last time, it'd be even funnier to see what happens if he dies during the night.</p>

<p>Kate wakes up the group the next day and announces that George has died. As he bids the group farewell with five seconds of MacBeth before Kate cuts him off, Michael accuses you of being mafia. As you try to make your defense, Michael reveals that he's the investigator (something he claims he didn't want to do) and reveals that he investigated you. Nothing you say helps you and you get voted out.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Dave (who you voted out on day 1) turned out to be the doctor, so Michael is killed the next night and Chloe and Steve manage to find their way to victory. However, since you died, you are not victorious in this adventure.</p>
