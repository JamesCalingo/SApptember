<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You choose to side with Chloe and vote to kill Michael. Steve ends up going with it because he thinks it's best to side with the majority.</p>

<p>When day arrives, everyone wakes up to no one having died the previous night. The doctor saved Michael, but you're one of only four people to know.</p>

<p>What's more, Michael reveals as the investigator and says that you're a mafia. You have no response to his allegation and get voted out.</p>
