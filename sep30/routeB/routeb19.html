<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Being a fan of the Super Smash Bros. competitive scene, you decide to take one of its most famous mottos - "No Johns!" - to heart and kill John.</p>

<p>Kate surprises you by referencing this phrase while announcing John's death. Your affection for her grows after this moment...</p>

<p>...but then you remember that her fiancee had to leave earlier in the night because he has to be somewhere early tomorrow.</p>

<p>The results of the game don't matter anymore: all you can think about is Kate making a reference you thought no one else knew, how she would've learned it given that her fiancee is, as far as you know, a casual Smash player at best, and how you now have an unrequited love.</p>
