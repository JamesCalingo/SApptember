<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>As strange as George's behavior is, you feel like you should stick to your original plan and vote out Dave. Kate stops George from talking and asks if anyone wants to nominate anyone else for voting.</p>

<p>You say that you thought you heard of felt motion coming from your right, and since Dave is sitting on your right, that he's probably a mafia. Dave tries to put up a defense, but it doesn't work - he's voted out.</p>

<p>During the second night, the mafia finds themselves at a bit of a crossroads: Chloe wants to vote out Michael, but Steve wants to vote George. They let you make the deciding vote.</p>
