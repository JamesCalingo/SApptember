<p>You decide that Steve is too much of a liability and join the town in voting him out.</p>

<p>When the night phase comes up, Chloe gives you a long, hard stare while you decide who your next target should be. You silently try to explain to her that you thought Steve was too much of a liability, which is why you let him get voted out.</p>

<p>The following day, Michael reveals that he is the investigator and that you are mafia. You get voted out as Chloe does nothing to help you.</p>
