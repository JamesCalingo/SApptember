<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You decide to side with Steve and vote for Brittany. Chloe seems a bit frustrated by your decision, but has to side with it anyway.</p>

<p>When Kate wakes everyone up for the day phase, she says that Brittany has died. You've got three dead villagers, and your influence in the town is growing...</p>

<p>...except Michael reveals as the investigator and says that Steve and Chloe are mafia. The next few days consist of you (unsuccessfully) trying to kill Michael, and the mafia getting voted out day by day. You end up being the last mafia alive...but easily get voted out by the town.</p>

<p>After the game, Chloe says that she wanted to kill Michael because they've played a lot of mafia together; for some reason, Chloe has a tendency to draw mafia, so Michael checked her on day one, found out she was mafia, and tried to guess who was with her by paying attention to the other players. He never bought Steve's bogus doctor claim, and since you were trying to push attention away from Steve, he deduced that you were probably a mafia as well.</p>
