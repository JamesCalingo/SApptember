<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You start yelling at Alex that the balance of the game is in his hands, without revealing who he should vote for.</p>

<p>Alex almost has a nervous breakdown as you launch into him. Steve joins you, but Olivia remains steadfast. Kate then asks the two of you to stop shouting (you'll wake up the neighbors at this rate!) and asks Alex who he wants to vote for.</p>

<p>Alex does a mental coinflip and ends up choosing...Steve.</p>

<p>You decide to kill Alex the next night, but Olivia and John figure you out as the last mafia and vote you out, thus losing the game for you.</p>
