<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You decide to go after Alex. He's not the most dangerous player, you feel, but he is someone that may be a threat later.</p>

<p>Here's the thing, though: Alex suspects Steve. He's not 100% on his suspicion, however, and says that he's not sure if Steve should be voted out. Steve, who is bad under pressure, rebuts Alex by claiming that he's actually the doctor, but when asked who he healed during the night, Steve hesitates before making a truly bizarre claim: he tried to heal whoever died the night before, but Kate messed up and thought he was trying to heal the person next to them.</p>

<p>Kate says nothing - well, actually, she says that she can neither confirm nor deny Steve's claim because that would affect the game in a way that would tilt the game towards either side. At this point, you're wondering if Steve will end up being more of a liability than an asset, but you're not sure if you want to lose a mafia member after the first round with so many villagers to get through.</p>
