<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You think for a second before siding with Chloe. She's played this game a lot, and she seems to know when others in the group are either lying or hiding information.</p>

<p>The next day, Kate announces Michael's death, and the group discussion yields no real traction. George continues his melodrama, and eventually the group tires of it and votes him out.</p>

<p>The following night, the mafia chooses to kill Erica. She's been quiet the whole game, which (to you) makes it seem like she's thinking hard before saying anything - which is both good and bad.</p>

<p>Kate announces Erica's death the following day, and things are looking pretty good - four town vs. three mafia. All you need to do is get one of the townspeople lynched and you win!</p>

<p>...and then Olivia accuses Chloe of being mafia. To her credit, Chloe is calm and collected in defending herself, but Alex and Brittany seem to believe Olivia more than Chloe.</p>

<h1>Do you help defend Chloe?</h1>
