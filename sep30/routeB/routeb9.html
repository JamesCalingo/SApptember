<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>You decide to go after Dave. You begin to form a plan on how to get him lynched, but before you can say anything, George decides to channel his inner Prince Hamlet.</p>

<p>George performs a monologue that you cannot believe wasn't pre-rehearsed, lamenting the "death" of his girlfriend (or sister) and preparing for his own death, even trying to invite the town to vote him out. While everyone laughs at George's antics, Kate says that there is a role (the Jester) whose goal is to get voted out by town, but that she didn't include that role in this game (she does, however, promise to include it next round).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you think about the ramafications of this move. George is known for his...outside the box thinking, and you're wondering if somehow, he managed to devise an elaborate play to get you to expose yourself as mafia.</p>

<h1>So what's the plan?</h1>
