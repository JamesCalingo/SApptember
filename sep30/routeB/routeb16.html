<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>As much as you'd like to win now, it'd probably be easier to avoid drawing suspicion from the townspeople. You say nothing and Chloe gets voted out - the only person who doesn't vote for her is Steve.</p>

<p>During the next night phase, you ponder which of the remaining townspeople to kill:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Olivia did get Chloe killed, but she also seems easy to manipulate</li>
  <li>Alex is openly clueless to who is mafia, but people seem to believe he's town</li>
  <li>Brittany and Olivia are super close and have a strong trust in each other, so whatever Olivia does Brittany tends to follow (which is probably a bad idea in a game like Mafia, but what do I know?)</li>
  <li>John is...just there. You kinda forgot he was in the game because he's been fairly quiet (and be honest, you probably forgot I put a John in the group way back in the intro).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Who do you wish to kill?</h1>
