<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You decide to get "revenge" on Olivia for getting Chloe voted out and choose to kill her. Kate even says when she announces Olivia's death that it seemed like the mafia was out for revenge.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, John deduces (correctly) that Steve is mafia and he gets voted out. You wished you could vote for Steve like you did for Chloe, but you figure that intentionally going down to 1 mafia is a very bad idea, so you vote for someone else.</p>

<p>This fact gets thrown in your face in the final round as you get voted out and lose the game.</p>
