<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>

  <p>You make an empassioned speech to the group, highlighting why you think Dave is part of the mafia. As you begin to talk, your voice becomes louder and you come very close to swearing a few times.</p>

  <p>Dave is unmoved by your speech. In fact, he's pushing harder to get you voted out, and now has support!</p>

  <p>You continue your rant to no avail; a few of your friends film your rant on their phones and then - despite you claiming that the group is about to make a big mistake - you get voted out.</p>

  <p>You get up from the circle, pace into and out of the living room, and Kate calls the mafia for the next night. As you see Dave open his eyes (thus proving that your suspicions were, in fact, truth), Kate gives you a death stare and a non-verbal warning: Don't. Say. Anything.</p>
