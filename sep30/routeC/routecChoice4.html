<p>You really can't get rid of your gut feeling that Dave is mafia. You just throw it out there and hope that it works.</p>

<p>It does.</p>

<p>Dave gets voted out, and you eventually learn that Dave was, in fact, mafia.</p>

<h1>How do you learn that Dave was mafia?</h1>

<p>The mafia kills you on night two, and when Kate calls the mafia the following night, you look around and see only two people open their eyes while Dave looks at you, waves, and nods his head.</p>

<p>You may have been right about Dave, but it got you killed...and in this game, getting killed means you lose.</p>
