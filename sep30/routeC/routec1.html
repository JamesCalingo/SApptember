<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You take the third card, and it is...the four of hearts. Looks like you're just an ordinary villager this game.</p>

<p>Kate tells everyone to close their eyes, which you do. After a series of events, everyone wakes up and Kate reveals that someone died during the night. That someone is not you, thankfully (it was Steve), and Kate proceeds to open the floor to discussion.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, you have a gut feeling: Dave (the person sitting next to you) is bad. You're not that experienced with this game, but you know that Dave is a super smart dude, and that if he is with the mafia, then </p>

<p>You tell the group that you think Dave's with the mafia...and he immediately rebuts you. Moreover, he says that he suspects YOU of being a mafia member.</p>
