<p>You take the third card, and it is...the four of hearts. Looks like you're just an ordinary villager this game.</p>

<p>Kate tells everyone to close their eyes, which you do. After a series of events, everyone wakes up and Kate reveals that someone died during the night. That someone is not you, thankfully, and Kate proceeds to open the floor to discussion.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, you have a gut feeling: Dave (the person sitting next to you) is bad. You're not that experienced with this game, but you know that Dave is a super smart dude, and that if he is with the mafia, then </p>

<p>You tell the group that you think Dave's with the mafia...and he immediately rebuts you. Moreover, he says that he suspects YOU of being a mafia member.</p>
