  <p>Anyway, you decide to walk out of the room for a bit (you claim you're going to the bathroom, but this is a lie).
    When you come back, you put your hands up to your ears like an elephant, stomp around for a bit, and then make some
    weird noises that I THINK are supposed to be elephant noises but sound more like mouth farts.</p>

  <p>While it does draw a few laughs, it doesn't draw any attention to you trying to argue your point. Dave, on the
    other hand, just says "look at what just happened...do you really think he's innocent after THAT?"</p>

  <p>You are voted out.</p>
