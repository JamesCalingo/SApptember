<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
<p>It's 1 AM on a Saturday night (or is it technically Sunday morning?). After a long day hanging out with friends, someone has decided to play Mafia with the group.</p>

<p>Kate (one of your friends) has chosen to be the moderator for this game. She has everyone sit in a circle in a large living room, full of couches, chairs, and even a cat named Degrasse. You take your seat, and then clockwise from you sit Michael, Steve, Erica, Brittany, Alex, Olivia, John, George, George's girlfriend whose name you can't remember right now, Chloe, and finally Dave.</p>
  
  <p>Kate explains how the game will work: everyone will either be with the town or the mafia. At night, the mafia will kill a townsperson, and then during the day, the town will deliberate who they think is mafia. To help the town, there is an investigator who will investigate one person each night (as opposed to being an alligator who's active on KickStarter or IndieGoGo, as George says), and a doctor who will heal one person each night.</p>
  
  <p>The game ends when either the town votes out all of the mafia, in which case town wins, or when the number of townspeople equals the number of mafia members, in which case the mafia wins.</p>

  <p>To determine everyone's role, Kate shuffles some cards and then starts to distribute them to the group. When she comes around to you, you are presented with three cards to choose from.</p>

  <h1>Which card do you choose?</h1>
<button class="btn btn-success" onclick="window.location.href = 'routeA/routea1.html'">Take card 1</button>
<button class="btn btn-success" onclick="window.location.href = 'routeB/routeb1.html'">Take card 2</button>
<button class="btn btn-success" onclick = "window.location.href = 'routeC/routec1.html'">Take card 3</button>
