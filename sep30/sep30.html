<h3 class="text-center">Today, on this last day of September, I've decided to do a choose-your-own-adventure story.</h3>
<h3>This adventure is based on the popular social deduction game Mafia. Before we continue, let me explain Mafia to the uninitiated: Mafia is a game where some players are mafia members who are trying to kill the rest of the group without being found out. The rest of the group (aka the town) is assisted by an investigator who checks people to see if they are mafia and a doctor who prevents people from being killed in the night. Kills, inspections, and heals take place during a "night" phase, while the town discusses the events of the game and chooses someone to vote out during the day.</h3>

<h3>You'll be given choices on how you want to proceed at certain points in the story. Choose wisely, though: some choices will end your game early, and in order to "win" this game, you need to survive to the end (normally, it is possible to win Mafia without surviving to the end, but not here!).</h3>
