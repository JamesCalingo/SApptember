<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You elect to give Alex the benefit of the doubt and NOT investigate him. Instead, you investigate Michael and find out that he is with the mafia.</p>

<p>Kate wakes the group up for the day phase and reveals that Alex has died, seemingly confirming Erica as a mafia. With your knowledge that Michael is one of two remaining mafia, you plan how to get Michael...</p>

<p>...but then, out of the blue, Brittany decides to speak up. She accuses you of being mafia, and Michael is very quick to jump onto it. At this point, you're pretty sure that they're working together as the last two mafia members, but they're starting to rally the rest of the group against you.</p>

<p>You could reveal now, but it comes with a risk: you have no idea whether or not the doctor is alive, and revealing makes it likely that you're dead next round. On the other hand, you could simply rebut Brittany's argument by pointing out that you sided with Alex and that he died during the night, thus proving that he was town and that you are as well.</p>
