  <p>You choose to try and get Michael voted out. With the town now behind you, it's almost certain that you're going to win this vote.</p>

  <p>Michael, Brittany, and another uncertain villager vote for you, but you have the majority and easily vote Michael out. Kate then moves the game to the next night phase.</p>

  <p>During this night phase, you choose to investigate Brittany and find out that she is, indeed, the last mafia member. Before you can announce the news to the town and claim victory, however...she kills you.</p>

  <p>Brittany is eventually voted out and the town wins...but YOU don't, cause you died before the end of the game.</p>
