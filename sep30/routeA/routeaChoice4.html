<p>You decide that revealing is too risky and that there's an easier way to defend yourself: Logic.</p>

<p>Alex tried to get Erica voted out and was immediately killed because of it. By virtue of being killed at night, Alex is immediately confirmed as a villager, and his accusation against Erica was likely valid.</p>

<p>Having said all of this, people in the room agree with you and feel like they can trust you now. You now have quite a bit of power...and an important decision to make.</p>

<p>While you're fairly certain Brittany is the last mafia member, you're not 100% sure - she could just be trying to random guess. Knowing that Michael is mafia also doesn't automatically make her mafia either - he could just be trying to get villagers voted out randomly, which helps mafia out quite a bit.</p>

<p>While going after Michael means that you're essentially guaranteed to get a mafia member, you could be in dire straits trying to find the last mafia if it's not Brittany. If you go after Brittany and it turns out she's NOT mafia, then you still have at least two killers on the loose (technically there COULD be three, but that's highly doubtful given the evidence you just laid out).</p>

<h1>With all this in mind, who do you try to vote out?</h1>
