<p>Which was a mistake.</p>
<p>The current day phase proceeds as normal: someone gets lynched, day turns to night and in the morning...</p>
<p>The mafia kills you. Michael was mafia and you told him you were their biggest target. Moreover, because the doctor didn't know you were the detective, he never thought to heal you.</p>
