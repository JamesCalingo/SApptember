<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You decide to tell Michael that you're the investigator.</p>
<p>Which was a mistake.</p>
<p>The current day phase proceeds as normal: someone (who, unfortunately, was not mafia) gets lynched, day turns to night, and the next morning...</p>
<p>The mafia kills you. Michael was mafia and you told him you were their biggest target. Moreover, the doctor (Alex) didn't know you were the investigator and never thought to heal you.</p>
