<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You take the first card and it is...</p>
<h1 class="mb-1">The Ace of Spades!</h1>
<small class="mb-3">(make your own Motorhead joke here)</small>
<p>You are the investigator for this round. Your role is to inspect people to see if they are part of the mafia.</p>
<p>Kate tells everyone to close their eyes, which you do. When she tells the investigator (you) to open your eyes, you do so. She tells you to point at someone who you think is a member of the mafia; out of sheer laziness, you point at Dave (who's sitting immediately on your right) and she indicates that he's not mafia.</p>

<p>When Kate wakes the group for the day phase, she announces that someone has died. Thankfully, it's not you - it's John. She then opens the floor for discussion.</p>

<p>Alex, who is sitting more or less directly across from you, makes an announcement: he thought he heard something during the mafia phase. He indicates that it sounded like a jingling of metal, and seeing as how Erica is the only one wearing multiple metal braclets, accuses her of being mafia.</p>

<p>Erica defends herself by saying she was just moving her arms around during the night randomly and apologizes for causing any confusion. Alex says that it's highly suspicious to make that claim immediately after being accused.</p>

<p>Erica and Alex go at each other, claiming that the other is mafia, until Kate stops the discussion and calls a vote. One by one, each person in the group chooses a person to vote out. You are the last vote, and Erica and Alex are tied.</p>

<h1>Who do you vote for?</h1>
