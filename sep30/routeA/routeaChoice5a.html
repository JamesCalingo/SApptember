<p>You reveal that you're the detective...by revealing your card.</p>

<p>Which is against the rules.</p>

<p>Kate says that you are now disqualified from participating in the game. Michael argues with you having done something as stupid as that, there's no possible way he can win now that his role as mafia is essentially 100% public knowledge. Kate agrees and declares that no one wins the game.</p>

<p>One of the villagers decides to read a poem they found on the internet in your honor. It goes like this:</p>

<p class="text-center"> Congratulations.<br>
  You cheated not only the game, but yourself.<br>  
    You didn't grow.<br>
    You didn't improve.<br>
    You took a shortcut and gained nothing.<br>
    You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained.<br>
    It's sad you don't know the difference.</p>

    <div class="display-1 text-center">YOU BLEW IT!</div>
