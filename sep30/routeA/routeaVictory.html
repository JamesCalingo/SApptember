<p>Man, I'm impressed. You really think you can win without revealing your role as the investigator. Well I guess we'll just see what happens from here...</p>

<p>Anyway, you don't reveal, but point out that Michael was very quick to hop onto Brittany's accusation last round. The village agrees with you and votes Michael out - unaniously.</p>

<p>Kate then announces that the town has won the game. As everyone celebrates, you reveal your card to everyone. Turns out that almost no one ever suspected that you were the detective for basically the whole game, which is why it seems like you were able to get away with so much.</p>

<p>Having proven your skills as a master player, you tell Kate that you'll take over moderating the next round. Everyone gives you their cards, you shuffle them, and then distribute them out to the players as another round begins with you in charge.</p>
