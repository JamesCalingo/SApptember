<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You're pretty sure there's no real need to reveal now. After all, you still have Alex's damning accusation from the last round. Instead, you ask if anyone heard the jingling during the previous night.</p>

<p>No one responds.</p>

<p>When you confront Erica on the noise from the last round, she reiterates that it was simply an honest mistake and that she won't do it again (TRANSLATION: she's using her other arm now). She then goes on a long rant wondering why you still seem suspicious of her when she already owned up to making a mistake. You know she's lying through her teeth, and yet the rest of the group seems to believe her moreso than you (probably because no one wants to believe she's a killer and she's not necessarily known as a good liar). It doesn't help when Brittany (who let's be honest, is probably mafia as well) starts accusing you of being with the mafia as well.</p>

<p>While you question when Erica learned to be so savage, she shifts her focus from Dave to you, and then somehow gets the town to vote you out.</p>

<p>Friendship ended with Erica. Now lonliness is your best friend.</p>
