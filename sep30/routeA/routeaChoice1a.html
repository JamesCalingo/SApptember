<p>You're pretty sure there's no real need to reveal now. After all, you still have Alex's damning accusation from the last round. Instead, you ask if anyone heard the jingling.</p>

<p>No one responds.</p>

<p>When you confront Erica on the noise from the last round, she reiterates that it was simply an honest mistake and that she won't do it again (TRANSLATION: she's using her other arm now). She then goes on a long rant wondering why you still seem suspicious of her when she already owned up to making a mistake. You know she's lying through her teeth, and yet the rest of the group seems to believe her moreso than you (probably because no one wants to believe she's a killer and she's not necessarily known as a good liar). It doesn't help when someone else (who let's be honest, is probably a mafia as well) starts accusing you of being with the mafia as well.</p>

<p>While you question when Erica learned to be so savage, she (and the rest of the mafia) somehow gets the town to vote you out.</p>
