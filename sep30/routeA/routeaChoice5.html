<p>Despite some inhibitions, you decide that Brittany accusing you is her trying to get the jump on accusations - an okay strategy for a mafia member, but you're not going to let the village fall for it.</p>

<p>You lead a charge to get Brittany voted out. With the town now behind you, you easily have the majority - though one of the other villagers ends up voting with Michael and Brittany. During the following night phase, you investigate this villager and learn that they are NOT mafia - just a bit confused.</p>

<p>Somehow, someway, you're still alive the next day. At this point, you're certain that Michael is the only mafia left, and voting him out will result in victory for the town. At this point, you may as well reveal as the detective, get Michael voted out, and claim an easy win.</p>

<h1>So...you're going to reveal that you're the detective, right?</h1>
