<title>Adventures in Mafia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Despite Erica being one of your closest friends, you choose to side with Alex this time. Like he said, it would be kinda weird for Erica to be flailing her arms around randomly during the night.</p>

<p>Kate then tells everyone to close their eyes for the next night phase. When your turn as the investigator comes up, a thought comes up:</p>

<p>Did Alex sell out a fellow mafia to gain clout with the group?</p>

<p>You ponder the possibilities: You know Alex to be very smart and somewhat ruthless, so it's very possible he's trying an incredibly bold strategy. On the other hand, though, what does he have to gain in eliminating a fellow mafia? It would mean less mafia versus more town, and Erica would probably have reacted somewhat differently if Alex was trying to sell her out...</p>

<p>Inasmuch as it would be bad for Alex to out a fellow mafia, you still can't fully eliminate the possiblity from your mind.</p>

<h1>Do you investigate Alex?</h1>
