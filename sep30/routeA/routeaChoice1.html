<p>As much as you want to believe Alex, something compels you to vote for him. Perhaps it's the fact that you consider Erica to be one of your closest friends, or maybe it's because you want to believe her story as you hear her bracelets jingle every time she moves her arms (which she's been doing a lot since Alex accused her). Either way, you decide to vote for Alex.</p>

<p>Alex makes flustered faces as Kate announces that he has been voted out. She then tells everyone to close their eyes and the second night begins. When you are up, you choose to investigate Erica to see if Alex was right.</p>

<p>You confirm your choice with Kate and she indicates that...guess what...</p>

<h1>Erica is a member of the mafia!</h1>

<p>Should've lisened to Alex.</p>

<p>When day arises, another player has been killed. You want to try to get Erica voted out since you now know she's mafia, but you're not sure how to do it. Revealing yourself as the detective would certainly get Erica voted out, but it also comes with a high risk of you being killed next round.</p>

<h1>What do you do?</h1>
