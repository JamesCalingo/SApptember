<p>You tell Michael that you're with the town. Michael again asks for your role, and you claim that you're not sure if you should say.</p>

<p>The day proceeds as normal (however, a townsperson gets voted out) and night falls, but the next day you find out that you were killed during the night.</p>

<p>Michael was able to infer from your statement that you had a significant role in the game (either the investigator or the doctor), and knew to take you out ASAP.</p>
