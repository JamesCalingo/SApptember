<div class="jumbotron text-center display-3">Happy Grand Final Day Everyone!</div>

<p>Today, of course, marks the date of one of the biggest sporting events of the year in southern hemisphere football:</p>
<h1>The AFL Grand Final!</h1>

<p>...but wait a sec...what the heck is the AFL? Or its Grand Final?</p>

<p>Well, I'm glad you asked person who I made up to set up today's webpage! I'll let this dude with a half American/half Australian accent explain the game:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMZYZcoAcU0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>So that should give you a good sense of how the game works. Now I'd like to go a bit deeper.</p>

<p>A typical season sees each team play 22 games over 23 weeks from March to August (the southern hemisphere winter). Usually, a team's season involves playing each other team at least once (17 games), though some teams are played twice. Due to how the league evoled into its current state (which involves a lesson in Australian geography that I'm not prepared to give), half the league is based in a single city (Melbourne), with a tenth team out in its suburbs; this also causes certain geographical rivalries to be born for the teams in other cities.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the season, the top 8 teams make what we would call the "playoffs", but are called "finals" in Australia. The format for that, by American standards, is WEIRD:</p>

In the first round: 
<ul>
  <li>The first placed team plays the fourth placed team</li>
  <li>The second placed team plays the third placed team</li>
  <li>The fifth placed team plays the eighth placed team</li>
  <li>The sixth placed team plays the seventh placed team</li>
</ul>
<p>The winners of the first two games essentially get a bye straight to the games before the final game (AKA the Grand Final), while the losers of those games have to play an extra game the following week. Those games are against the winners of the second pair of games (5 v. 8 and 6 v. 7); the losers of those games are eliminated.</p>

<p>From there, it's relatively straightforward (and pretty similar to one half of the NFL playoffs): the winners from the second round of games play the winners from the first week; and then whoever wins those games goes to the aforementioned Grand Final. Whoever wins that game is the champion (or premier) of that season.</p>

<p>That's pretty much a basic overview of the Australian Football League. Why am I doing this? Because I think that this sport is actually a lot of fun to watch and had this idea for a while (in case you forgot, I mentioned Australian football back when I did an NFL scoreboard, and like I said there, you could feasibly use that for this sport as well).</p>

  <p>(P.S.: Congrats to the Richmond Tigers, winners of the 2019 season. Because, y'know...by the time I'm posting this it's already the next day in Australia because time zones.)</p>
